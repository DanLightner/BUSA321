This suggests there are significant statistical differences in the average ratings between the different genres: Action, Drama, Comedy, Horror, and Romance. Since the p-value is so small, it indicates that itâ€™s highly unlikely these differences happened by chance. In other words, the genre of a movie seems to have a noticeable impact on its average rating.
